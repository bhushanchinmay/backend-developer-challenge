# Backend Developer Challenge

Assignment is to create a gaming bot and implement some basic commands. [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) Discord is a chat platform, itâ€™s mostly used by gaming community. We want you to create a basic Discord bot. See the instructions below for the assignment.

# Instructions

* Signup with discord (http://discordapp.com). 

* Create a simple discord bot that would reply **hey** to your **hi**. 

* Add functionality to discord bot to allow user to search on google through discord. If a user types **!google nodejs**, reply with top 5 links that you would get when you search **nodejs** on **google.com**

* Implement functionality to search through your search history. If a user uses **!google** to search for **"nodejs"** **"apple games"** **"game of thrones"**, and after these searches, if user types **!recent** game, your bot should reply with **"apple games"** and **"game of thrones"**

* Make user search history persistent. Use any storage system to store your searches, so that event when you kill your nodejs server and start again, your search history is maintained.

* You canuse any languages like Python,Nodejs,Golang, etc to implement this.

Once you are done, please share with us:
1. Source code link (GitHub, BitBucket, etc)
2. Share us the Discord bot name and details , so that we can add it to our server and try it out.
